    <title>Proposal: PDF Data Extraction to Excel</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Proposal: PDF Data Extraction to Excel with Embedded Images</h1>

    <h2>Client's Request</h2>
    <p>You have a 700-page PDF file that requires extraction of both text and images. The extracted text needs to be formatted in a standard, readable manner, while the images should be embedded directly within the corresponding Excel cells.</p>

    <h2>Scope of Work</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>PDF Text Extraction</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Extract the text content from all 700 pages of the PDF.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the text is structured logically, maintaining the original formatting and flow as much as possible.</li>
                <li>Organize the text into Excel, with each page’s content on a separate row.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Image Extraction and Embedding</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Detect and extract all images embedded in the PDF.</li>
                <li>Resize and embed the images within the Excel file, ensuring that they are placed in the corresponding cells next to the relevant text.</li>
                <li>Ensure that images are properly scaled to fit neatly within each cell, without distorting the aspect ratio.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Excel File Output</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>The final output will be a well-formatted Excel file where:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Column A</strong> contains the page numbers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Column B</strong> contains the extracted text from each page.</li>
                    <li><strong>Column C</strong> contains the embedded images corresponding to each page.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>The Excel file will be easy to read, with appropriate formatting (e.g., adjusted column widths for text and images).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tools and Methodology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Libraries:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><code>pandas</code> for data structuring and Excel output.</li>
                <li><code>PyMuPDF (fitz)</code> for extracting both text and images from the PDF.</li>
                <li><code>Pillow</code> for image processing.</li>
                <li><code>openpyxl</code> for creating and formatting the Excel file.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Parse the 700-page PDF and extract the content.</li>
                <li>Process and clean up the extracted text.</li>
                <li>Identify and extract images from each page and embed them into the corresponding Excel cells.</li>
                <li>Generate the final Excel file with neatly formatted text and embedded images.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Final Excel File</strong>: An Excel workbook containing:
            <ul>
                <li>All the text extracted from the PDF file, formatted in an organized and readable manner.</li>
                <li>Images from the PDF embedded within the appropriate Excel cells.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Timely Updates</strong>: Progress reports during the extraction process, especially given the large file size (700 pages).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
